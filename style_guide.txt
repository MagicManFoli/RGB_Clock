This is just a short document to give guidelines:

snake_case instead of camelCase
braces in next line

add "editor.rulers": [80] to User settings

all classes go into lib\name_of_class
use Doxygen style function headers when reasonable
define magic numbers on top of a file
expose only as much of a class as needed

prevent global variables if possible


DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID, ...
