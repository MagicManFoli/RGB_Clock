This is just a short document to give guidelines:

snake_case instead of camelCase
braces in next line

add "editor.rulers": [80] to User settings

all classes go into lib\name_of_class
define magic numbers on top of a file
expose only as much of a class as needed

use Doxygen style (Java) comment blocks in header when reasonable
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html 

prevent global variables if possible
use uint8_t and friends instead of generic ints

use if(debug){} when dealing with Serial and other temporary output 

personal includes with "", generic libraries with <>

DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID, WS.NH ...
